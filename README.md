redis-landlord-srv
==================

Description
-----------
A server for redis-landlord (https://github.com/palpha/redis-landlord).

Prerequisites
-------------
You'll need Go to compile, and redis-landlord (see above).

Usage
-----
Compile, copy the configuration file and change it to suit your setup. Run the service any way you see fit.

Mandatory warning and disclaimer
--------------------------------
This thing is my first Go experiment, and it is not currently in use anywhere. The state of things is uncertain. It might work for you, it might very well not even compile. If you're a Go wizard and find the concept here useful, fork and contribute!
